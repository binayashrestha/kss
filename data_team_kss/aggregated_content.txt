Hey Team! :tada:
Just a heads up about our company holiday calendar (Nepal)! Here’s the breakdown:
Annual Holidays: We get 13 of these each year, celebrating special occasions we all enjoy. :spiral_calendar_pad:
Substitute Holidays: Since 6 annual holidays landed on weekends this year, we added 5 substitute holidays on other dates to keep it fair. :alarm_clock:
Floating Holiday: That remaining one holiday? It’s yours to choose! Use it for a personal celebration, urgent work, or however you like. :balloon:
So, to sum it up, we have 12 defined company holidays this year, plus one floating holiday that you can use as you like! :confetti_ball:
Please also make sure to add Holiday Nepal 2024/2025 to your calendar.
